# Laravel - File Storage

This project is for the management and handling of files in Laravel and to be able to save any type of file in local storage (disk).

## Documentation

Right now it only has one driver which is in its initial version, i.e. it would be necessary to debug code and make services to optimise and follow SOLID principles.

The controller is ImagenController, it has two functions:

Store-> This method is responsible for receiving a file via Api, regardless of its extension and saves it, to see where it is saved you have to go to storate>subjects and there will be the file. To be able to obtain it, it saves in the database the name of the file that you have saved to be able to make a query for it and obtain it.

Show-> function in charge of returning a file according to its name.
