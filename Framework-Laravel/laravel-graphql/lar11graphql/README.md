# Laravel - GraphQL 

This proyect is a backend with laravel and use GraphQl that is a query languaje, To integrate this I have used the ligthouse library


## API Reference

#### Get all items

```http
  GET /graphql
  POST /graphql
  PUT /graphql
  DELETE /graphql
```

This is all the endpoints of the app, becaouse the benefit of graphql its with one endpoint you can ask for all the data.







## Documentation

This is the first version of the Api, and this have all the endpoints of users ready to use, yuo can create a user, edit, select all the users paginated and select one user by his ID.

If you want to use the api, I recommend you to use postman with the GraphQl request, as it will provide you with a UI for the queries and you don't have to worry about thinking about the queries and you will see the results and the queries.
